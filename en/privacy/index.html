<h2 id="1-an-overview-of-data-protection">1. An overview of data protection</h2>
<p>The following information will provide you with an easy to navigate overview of
what will happen with your personal data when you visit our website. The term
“personal data” comprises all data that can be used to personally identify you.
For detailed information about the subject matter of data protection, please
consult our Data Protection Declaration, which we have included beneath this
copy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Data recording on our website</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Who is the responsible party for the recording of data on this website (i.e.
the “controller”)?</strong></p>
<p>The data on this website is processed by the operator of the website, whose
contact information is available under section &ldquo;Legal Notice&rdquo; on this website.</p>
<p><strong>How do we record your data?</strong></p>
<p>We collect your data as a result of your sharing of your data with us. This may,
for instance be information you enter into our contact form. Our IT systems
automatically record other data when you visit our website. This data comprises
primarily technical information (e.g. web browser, operating system or time the
site was accessed). This information is recorded automatically when you access
our website.</p>
<p><strong>What are the purposes we use your data for?</strong></p>
<p>A portion of the information is generated to guarantee the error free provision
of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user patterns.</p>
<p><strong>What rights do you have as far as your information is concerned?</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients and
purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having to pay a fee
for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand that your data are
rectified, blocked or eradicated. Please do not hesitate to contact us at any
time under the address disclosed in section &ldquo;Legal Notice&rdquo; on this website if
you have questions about this or any other data protection related issues. You
also have the right to log a complaint with the competent supervising agency.
Moreover, under certain circumstances, you have the right to demand the
restriction of the processing of your personal data. For details, please consult
the Data Protection Declaration under section “Right to Restriction of Data
Processing.”</p>
<p><strong>Analysis tools and tools provided by third parties</strong></p>
<p>There is a possibility that your browsing patterns will be statistically
analysed when your visit our website. Such analyses are performed primarily with
cookies and with what we refer to as analysis programmes. As a rule, the
analyses of your browsing patterns are conducted anonymously; i.e. the browsing
patterns cannot be traced back to you. You have the option to object to such
analyses or you can prevent their performance by not using certain tools. For
detailed information about this, please consult our Data Protection Declaration
below. You do have the option to object to such analyses. We will brief you on
the objection options in this Data Protection Declaration.</p>
<h2 id="2-data-protection">2. Data Protection</h2>
<p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal
data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential
information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and
this Data Protection Declaration. Whenever you use this website, a variety of
personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be
used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which
data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains
how, and for which purpose the information is collected. We herewith advise you
that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through e-mail
communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely
protect data against third party access. Information about the responsible party
(referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>The data processing controller on this website is:</strong></p>
<address>
  Milecrew GmbH<br />
  Gürzenichstrasse 21a-c<br />
  50667 Cologne<br />
  E-Mail:
  hello@milecrew.com
</address>

<p>The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or
jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the
processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</strong></p>
<p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your
express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already
given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal
notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of
any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
<p><strong>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to
directadvertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</strong></p>
<p>In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. e or f
GDPR, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your
personal data based on grounds arising from your unique situation. This also
applies to any profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal
basis, on which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data
Protection Declaration. If you log an objection, we will no longer process your
affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present compelling
protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your
interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the
claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to
Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR). If your personal data is being processed in order to
engage in direct advertising, you have the right to at any time object to the
processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising.
This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with such
direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no
longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21
Sect. 2 GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</strong></p>
<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a
complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where
they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the
alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless
of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>
<p><strong>Right to data portability</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process
on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to
you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable format. If you should
demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done
only if it is technically feasible.</p>
<p><strong>SSL and/or TLS encryption</strong></p>
<p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content,
such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator,
this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption programme. You can recognise
an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock
icon in the browser line. If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you
transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data</strong></p>
<p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to
at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source
and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data. You may
also have a right to have your data rectified, blocked or eradicated. If you
have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal
data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time at the address provided
in section “Information Required by Law.”</p>
<p><strong>Right to demand processing restrictions</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the
processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at
any time at the address provided in section “Information Required by Law.” The
right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases: In the
event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we
will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this
investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the
processing of your personal data. If the processing of your personal data was/is
conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction
of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this
data. If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the
restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.
If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights
and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not
been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a
restriction of the processing of your personal data. If you have restricted the
processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their
archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise
or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons
or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European
Union or a member state of the EU.</p>
<h2 id="3-recording-of-data-on-our-website">3. Recording of Data on our Website</h2>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>In some instances, our website and its pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do
not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. The purpose of
cookies is to make our website more user friendly, effective and more secure.
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer and stored by your
browser. Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are
automatically deleted after your leave our site. Other cookies will remain
archived on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to
recognise your browser the next time you visit our website. You can adjust the
settings of your browser to make sure that you are notified every time cookies
are placed and to enable you to accept cookies only in specific cases or to
exclude the acceptance of cookies for specific situations or in general and to
activate the automatic deletion of cookies when you close your browser. If you
deactivate cookies, the functions of this website may be limited. Cookies that
are required for the performance of the electronic communications transaction or
to provide certain functions you want to use (e.g. the shopping cart function),
are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has
a legitimate interest in storing cookies to ensure the technically error free
and optimised provision of the operator’s services. If other cookies (e.g.
cookies for the analysis of your browsing patterns) should be stored, they are
addressed separately in this Data Protection Declaration.</p>
<p><strong>Server log files</strong></p>
<p>The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores
information in so-called server log files, which your browser communicates to us
automatically. The information comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type and version of browser used</li>
<li>The used operating system</li>
<li>Referrer URL</li>
<li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
<li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
<li>The IP address</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This data is not merged with other data sources.</strong></p>
<p>This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The operator
of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction
and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to achieve this, server
log files must be recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Request by e-mail or telephone</strong></p>
<p>If you contact us by e-mail or telephone, your request, including all resulting
personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose
of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.
The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your
request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry
out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on
your consent (Article 6 (1) a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Article
6 (1) (f) GDPR), since we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing
of requests addressed to us. The data sent by you to us via contact requests
remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the
storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of
your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory
retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</strong></p>
<p>We collect, process and use personal data only to the extent necessary for the
establishment, content organization or change of the legal relationship (data
inventory). These actions are taken on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR,
which permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or
pre-contractual actions. We collect, process and use personal data concerning
the use of our website (usage data) only to the extent that this is necessary to
make it possible for users to utilize the services and to bill for them. The
collected customer data shall be eradicated upon completion of the order or the
termination of the business relationship. This shall be without prejudice to any
statutory retention mandates.</p>
